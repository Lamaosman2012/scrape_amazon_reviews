I purchased this item about a month ago, and so far my only complaint is it does have water on the inside of the fridge.",

Does have condensation on the inside. Ive also put nipple serums and ointments for breastfeeding that remain cold. I prep my sons bottles for that day and put them in the fridge. I do not over fil the inside at all.All in all, i really hope it stays functional.",

It seems flimsy and something that will break eventually.Capacity wise, it\u2019s really compact.  Maybe a little too compact.  It can fit the Medela breast milk bags and the smaller sized bottles, but I think it\u2019ll get too cramped if I want to put breast pump parts ie flanges and tubes in there too.Temperature wise, it seems like it\u2019ll be fine for storing breast milk.I like that it came with car adapters too so if I was going on a long drive, this can definitely be taken along for the ride.  In this scenario, this size would be preferable.

However it is too loud and have to turn it off at night which defeats the purpose of why I bought it. I like my face creams cool in the morning. Also it tends to get hot if left on for more than 8hrs. I hope it's a lemon and will be looking to return when I'm able too.",

When I open it, the latch gets stuck and won't return to the closed position so the door will not stay closed. 3) It does NOT hold bottles like it says in the description.  I can't find a standard 20 oz bottle no matter how I try to put it in there.  It just won't fit.  Only good for cans and mini 12 oz bottles.

    "text": "UPDATE:Firstly, this listing was originally for the name brand Igloo mini fridge, now it shows an RCA logo instead. Guess it was a knock-off which now makes sense. It's completely broken after minimal use. The motor inside started to fail and made loud wailing sounds that got louder. I immediately shut it off when I realized it was the motor, but it no longer cools ANYTHING. It actually heats up whatever's inside because of the heat the power is generating is now insulated inside, while no cold conditioned air comes in whatsoever. Very upset and disappointed. I paid an arm and leg for this piece of junk!! Really depended on this and can't afford to replace this with another unit that'll surely fail outside of the return period.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Exactly what I was looking for. So quiet. Perfect aesthetic. Works like a dream",

Also, the image on the box showed 6 cans placed horizontally in it, but only 5 will fit that way. While this came with a limited warranty, I would have to pay shipping both ways, and honestly at that point it would make more sense to just buy it again and receive a brand new one. Over all it was nice while it lasted, though.",

Some people's reviews stated that they didn't get the retro one like in picture, however I got the exact retro one in the photos. It works, but doesn't get super cold obviously. It only held the mini cans of pop but for the price I didn't expect it to live up to a more expensive ones. Basically a toy, but does have car plug in as well as a regular outlet cord which I thought was cool. Seems well made and carry handle on top is awesome.",
