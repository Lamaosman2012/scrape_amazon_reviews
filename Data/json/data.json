    "text": "My model is the 1.6 cubic feet fridge.The refrigerator can cram a surprising number of things inside, but there are some substantial caveats to that. As is easily seen from the pictures, the fridge has an upside-down L shape volume, i.e. the back side is a raised shelf. This is unfortunate in many ways, because* You cannot fit a full gallon of milk anywhere (as far as I can tell at least)* Anything plate-sized is a challenge to fit in the fridge. Obviously it must go on the back shelf, but by itself there is a chance it'll topple off balance because the shelf is barely deep enough to hold the plate. The included rack or a short object in front would of course solve this issue, but then there's no room for tall objects like half gallon milk jugs.* Certain fatter objects (but not as fat as a gallon of milk) will prevent the door from closing if there is also a large-ish object in the door shelf (the rod that you can see holding the 2 L soda in the Amazon image rotates to accomodate space). There is a reason why all of the Amazon images are shot at a low angle, so it's hard to see how deep the front space isn't. Other customer images demonstrate that the bottom shelf is like 2.5 cans of soda deep when the door rod is swung out (interesting unit to measure things...).Thus, don't expect to fit a pizza in here. Most takeout containers are small enough to cram into various spots in the fridge, but it's not guaranteed (especially pasta containers).I considered doing a systematic study of the temperature gradient in the fridge at different settings, but I found that the temperature didn't change much between the pseudo-freezer compartment in the top right and the opposite corner in the door (that is, the entire fridge is fairly even in temperature). Thus, I leave my fridge in the middle cold setting. At this setting, milk sitting in the door will not spoil faster than expected, and things directly under the pseudo-freezer will experience some light freezing sometimes. The pseudo-freezer itself is not much colder - you can freeze water in here, but I would not recommend storing ice cream.As for other aspects of the fridge - it's compact, quiet, and easy to clean. In the beginning it might seem loud, but that's because it's starting up for the first time at room temperature. Note that you should leave the fridge open for an hour before plugging it in to get rid of the smell - after that it's odorless.",

It spend a few years in an office and then I went to AA and it took a year off and sat on the shelf unplugged in my garage. It was ran over a few times and it seems like the door got knocked off.

    "text": "YES THE BACK PANEL IS OPEN. It is open to some scary looking wires and coils and machinery, but when you read the information it is supposed to be that way so it can release heat efficiently.Do not push this up totally against a wall. It needs to vent back there. Keep it away from the wall a few inches at least. I keep mine 6 inches.Also I read a review where they said the power cord was missing from their fridge. And when mine arrived I was horrified because I thought the same happened to mine. I could not find the power cord. Until I was able to find it in the back opening wedged tightly inside all of the scary looking wires, machinery and coils. It was difficult to get it out because it was wedged so tightly in. I kept wondering if I was pulling on something I shouldn't have because of how hard it was to free.So if yours arrives and you cant find the cord look for a big round black cord if you cant find the plug in. Slowly inch it out of there trying to avoid pulling anything you shouldn't.It feels like a sketchy fridge when it arrives. And it might actually be sketchy, it IS pretty cheap. But all in all I am happy with mine! I will just say you should ABSOLUTELY READ THE THICK INSTRUCTION BOOKLET THAT COMES WITH IT. Yes, it is a bore to read and a lot of it feels like common sense, but it is worth reading so you know how to properly set it up and use it. I think I have common sense and if I had not read the instructions I would have set it up in a risky way.Ever since its been set up I am loving it. I have had it for 6 months now. The temp control is not the best. Half the time I change it it feels like it got colder when I set it to warmer. It gets very very cold. Too cold for my soda on the last 3 dials. Frost WILL BUILD UP in the ice compartment and if you have anything under the ice compartment in the tray/drawer it will become frozen. Anything you just want cold keep it to the left side.In the door, the top shelf with the plastic bar will not fit a regular sized soda can vertically without breaking the plastic bar. It will only fit if you put one on its side. However it can fit 3 mini sized soda cans sitting vertically.The bottom door shelf will not fit a 2 liter but it can fit a 1 liter.Every once in a while it will make a louder than normal buzzing sound that concerns me from time to time. But its only happened like 3 times, it gradually and gradually got louder. I couldn't figure out why it was making more noise and by the time I could investigate it would stop and go back to normal. Its not loud when its at its normal volume level. You can hear there's a fridge in your room but its not gonna disturb you from reading or sleeping.Sometimes it makes this wooshing noise that I actually like. It sounds like a fish tank.In any case, is it perfect? No way. But is it doing what I expected for what I paid? Absolutely. I am just happy that my roommates can't steal my soda without seriously violating boundaries. They wouldn't dare enter my room to take a soda. I used to just drink warm soda to keep it from being stolen but now its a win win.",

    "text": "I needed a compact and quiet refrigerator for my bedroom so I bought this one.  This is a nice refrigerator.  It has a good look.  I used it for a week and as far as I could tell, it worked very well.  It kept my food cool.  I also think it has a good/decent amount of space for a compact refrigerator.  But it is noisy.  When doing my research for \"quiet compact refrigerators\" this specific Midea refrigerator came up.  It is a little quieter than some of the others I tried but it made this continuous gurgling sound that really stuck out and was annoying.  I really wanted to keep this refrigerator but I couldn't deal with the gurgling sound so I returned it.  The other thing I found a little annoying was the cord being tucked in all the way in the back to the point that it got stuck and was hard to pull out.  I almost thought the cord was something else because I couldn't get the the actual cord unstuck.  I called their customer service number for support and the good thing is I was able to speak to a representative right away.  So kudos for good customer support.  If you are looking for a quiet compact refrigerator for a bedroom, I suggest the Galanz 1.7 Cu ft Single Door Mini-Fridge, Black, eStar.  I tried a few other refrigerators and it's the quietest I found at an affordable price.  I've been using the Galanz for over a month and I've been happy with it.  I hope this is helpful!",

During that time it has endured 2 heatwaves it handled like a champ. Im talking 100 degrees plus for days without relief except for night time. The directions say to keep in coolest area, do not expose to direct sun, it needs a dedicated outlet, and do not use an extension cord. Upon investigating why not to use an extension cord I found out there could be voltage drop when using a cord too long which can possibly cause damage to compressor so that is important to follow. Hopefully that helps to know in advance because i didnt find out until receiving product. Not sure if that info was available. I love it. Once I rearranged the shelving to fit a milk gallon jug on the lowest shelf(the very bottom), then I put a rack, then I put a little half rack just above it and theres the top with the freezer at the top. I use a completely seperate freezer so this works as an excellent fridge and stores more food than I actually expected(expect the worst, hope for the best).

The freezer works very well, however, and I've managed to cram plenty of other things in there. The only \"complaint\" I can think of is that the way the metal bars are set means that I've had to take one out to fit in milk gallons, but that's hardly a problem as I can fit two of them, a 1.5L of orange juice, two pitchers of water, and a six pack of mike's hards all on one row. (This is not ALL I fit in the fridge, I also have a variety of groceries elsewhere but this is a good depiction of the flat surface layout.I originally got this fridge because my old fridge was simply too much of an energy drain and this has made a significant impact on my electric bill. It's quiet enough that it's only really audible from a handful of feet away. The temperature control is very strong. I wish the size compartment for 12oz cans could be removed (maybe it can be? I could fuss with it more I suppose) so that I could more effectively use the space and the side bars towards the bottom are a bit flimsier than I'd like. The top side bar works just fine; I've crammed a 12 pack of caprisun into it.",

    "text": "The mini-fridge works pretty well. The \"freezer\" seems to be rather over-hyped as a selling point, though. While I do trust that this freezer could freeze a soda can until explosion, it would take quite awhile (unless you cranked the chill to max) and you couldn't fit much into the freezer space either.The design of the door \"compartments\" seems a bit strange as well. It's kind of cool that you can fit a lot of 12oz cans in the door, there are some \"odd squeezes\" that take place to really maximize the space in the door. Overall though, not a terrible design, just a little different. The selves have that strange height \"in between\"  shelves, were you may be able to squeeze a full gallon of milk in, sideways, but  a jar of whole dill pickles standing up would likely be too tall for any space except the center \"rack\". Again, not a bad design, just not really suited for a lot of \"common container sizes\" that you find at the grocery store. It has been a GREAT beer cooler and liquor cabinet though.I could probably mess around with removing one of the racks/shelves it comes with to play with fitting something like a gallon jug or a \"full size\" Orange Juice container \"right side up\" but I feel like that's just trading off the larger space that I wanted for replacing a much smaller mini-fridge. The price was probably about 30-40 over what I would have expected from a clearance sale or something of that nature, but overall I'd say a 4/5 rating is about right. Not an awesome value, but if I were only looking to ever use this as a beer/can cooler only, I'd probably love it. If you packed them all in there tightly, I bet you could probably get 40-50+ 12oz cans into this thing if you \"worked them into the door spaces\" the right way.",

I believe the item I ordered is the same as this one, except mine has a wood-grain finish. Received item in great shape, no dents on the boxes (it was double boxed, with straps around the interior box, and the whole thing was very packaged by Midea. There was no Amazon packaging at all, on this.) The manual recommended letting it stand for 1/2 hr before use, but I let it stand 24 hours to let coolant settle (as I'd read on many refrig reviews. The manual also recommended that it cool for 2 hours before filling.) I have no complaints at all about this item - there were 5 five star reviews earlier, for this item, which made it the only compact refrig I found, with no negative feedback - but Amazon may have merged those into the item no. I mentioned earlier. It makes almost no sounds, slight low popping sound once in while. I've kept it slightly above Medium level which results in temp. of between 36-40, depending where I place thermometer. At this temp. ice cream is soft, but still ice cream, ie. not soupy. I'll post again when I buy some buy ice cream and increase the cooling setting. Only a few ice cream bar or pops could fit in freezer, though you could repackage your ice cream to fit it in. So far, I recommend it highly, especially at under $130. By the way the interior looks like that on the other model I mentioned above, though the finish is the wood grain here, and I think it looks cool, besides cooling well.",

I honestly don't know how that affects it considering my house was 70-80 degrees. Was going to return it but my mom suggested cranking the temperature to max. Worked like a charm. Keeps my drinks cold. I did notice it got louder in the span of a month but personally, I only notice it when I sleep and its not distracting enough for it to interrupt my sleep.Alot of people asked about the freezer space. It definitely does not get cold enough even on max temperature to keep frozen items, assuming that the items would fit. I can probably fit like 8 firecracker popsicles in the section and it would keep it cold for an hour. I think the temperature control isn't very good because I tested with a single popsicle and it melted and refroze over a day's worth of storage. I usually put a single ice cream cone or bar in there if I know I'm going to eat it within an hour so I don't have to go down to the kitchen.

If is wasn't for the first incident, this would have definitely received 5 stars from me.It arrived yesterday and I was excited because it arrived in perfect condition, no dents, scratches etc. I'm using this at work and it fits perfectly under my desk. I love the size. Read and followed the instructions and thought it was up and running. Once it got cold I put my lunch for the next day inside. Came into work this morning and it was NOT cold!  Not even cool! I don't know what happened but it's not working. It has the nerve to hum as if it's doing something but sad to say I'm returning.  I'm going with a replacement of the same model because I like the size. So I'll give it one more try. I'll update after the new one arrives. Oh yeah, now I have to lug this thing to a Kohl's or UPS store.  If I wanted to lug a fridge I'd have gone to a store to buy one. But at least I don't have to pay for the shipping.Signed... Disappointed but hopeful!",

My past experience with small refrigerators was that they had to have the temp control turned up very high to keep things really cool but this one is an exception!  I initially turned it pretty high (based on previous experience) but after 2 days found my liquids to be freezing so I turned it down little by little until I found just the right setting to keep things just above freezing and that setting is about \"2\".  I think this refrigerator would work as a freezer if you left it turned to the highest setting! I chose this model mostly because it's efficiency rating was about the highest amongst small fridges.

Make sure it's not leaking on arrival, or when you're taking it out. I didn't see any leaks so I plugged it in. It's keeping thinks nice and cold...my setting is on 3. I use mine as a refrigerator, but it can also be used as a freezer.UPDATE AS OF JULY 2018:Originally I gave this 3 stars, but I added an extra star since this mini fridge is still going and absolutely perfect...no problems. It's funny...it used to be a little noisy too for the first year, but now it's rather quiet and runs smoothly whilst getting everything nice and cold. It's well made. I'm happy with it. I think the backside got loose when I first bought it possibly due to rough handling of the post office.",

Even small refrigerators are notorious noise-makers, but this one makes only a subdued whirr when it runs.+ It's not going to fit a ton of stuff, but it stores more than I thought.Minus:- Frost builds up very quickly on the freezer section.- The temperature is not even throughout the fridge. Items stored on the handy little tray under the freezer section tend to freeze, but if you set the temperature control lower to avoid this, the rest of the items in the fridge do get cold enough.- The room for tall standing items doesn't fit much more than a one quart carton of milk or one wine bottle. There is room for 2 bottles to be laid on their sides on the shelves, but the shelf space is lost.",

The freezer part is small, like most mini fridges, and if you stuff too much in it, they'll melt. I made that mistake when I tried to put too much ice cream in it. I got this so people in the house kept stealing all of my drinks from the main fridge, but honestly, this doesn't stop them. Now they just come in my room and steal them. It was really easy to set up, just take off the tape and plug it in. I turned the temp two numbers down from the coldest, which keeps it from freezing my drinks. I recommend not putting anything under/right next to the freezer that you don't want frozen, because it will freeze. Honestly, it should've been common sense, but I didn't realize it until my ham was frozen. Overall, I really like mini fridge and highly recommend it!",

When this smallest version came up on Amazon Warehouse I knew I had to snatch it up. It arrived in perfect condition and was very easy to get setup. It is very convenient to be able to keep snacks and drinks just under my desk. And most importantly the milk I pump for my baby multiple times per day. I don't have to worry about someone messing with my items in the shared kitchen fridge and I don't even have to leave my office to put things away. It stays very cold and the sound of the motor doesn't bother me.",

It had a light silver circle sticker where a deformation occurred. I decided to remove it, and it exposed a chemical known as TETRAETHYLENE GLYCOL DIACRYLATE. Go ahead and read up on this stuff, and know that this was a about a foot away from my head, with multiple pets, my spouse, and sometimes a candle in our bedroom, along with other electrical components near it. Then add that upon checking the whole unit, this thing was expanded and leaking around the ENTIRE edge underneath, out of the piping, and all had been doctored due to this, terrible I might add, as well as finding a bar code with a red triangle on it that looks like it says, no (something) UPC. I'm unsure what, but the feeling I got was \" cannot sell\" and \"legally dispose\". It was stamped over the area to scan the bar. This is a bad thing to experience, especially knowing it wasn't the delivery, because of finding all the stuff showing premeditated knowledge.",

Even when I'm right next to it, all I hear (sometimes) is a slight bubbling noise in the back. This fridge gets COLD, too. (In fact, our milk froze solid when I turned the knob to 75% of it's max cooling power, so keep that in mind!) It's also nice-looking\u2014the chrome front is a nice touch.",

It was kind of loud and made a clunking sound every time it shut off. The clunk got louder and louder each day. I contacted the company to see if there was any trouble shooting I could do. The only option the person at the call center could offer, in their very broken English, was to return it. Went through the hassle of re-boxing and returning AGAIN only to have them charge me a restocking fee of $45. There was no restocking this thing, it was broken. So for all my effort or unpacking, repackaging and returning these pieces of junk, I got charged $45. Lousy product, lousy company, unhappy customer!",

    "text": "I purchased this product in October 2016.  Its purpose was to cool bottled drinks to reduce clutter in the main refrigerator.  It was housed indoors at all times, was plugged into a surge protector, with nothing else sharing the surge protector or electrical outlet.  The item was not overtaxed or abused in any way, and the sole expectation of it was to chill bottled drinks and keep them cold.  Low and behold, on February 9, 2017 (approx. 16 months after purchase), the refrigerator stopped working.  After the usual checks for surge protector tripped or off, loose plug, tripped breaker, etc., I tried the old \"unplug and plug it back in\" approach.  Nothing. Dead. Dead. Dead.  My recommendation to you is that if you think 16 months of service is a good value after spending about $80 (thus averaging approx. $5 per month), then knock yourself out.  As for me,I'll never purchase this or any other Midea product again.\u00a0\n  \nMidea WHS-65LB1 Compact Single Reversible Door Refrigerator, 1.6 Cubic Feet(0.045 Cubic Meter), Black",

We did not move it (it stays in my home office as normal); it was plugged into a surge protector as recommended, and we did not add anything extra or do anything different than normal. Going through the process will now be a hassle for something we had less than a year. I now would definitely NOT recommend this item.Original Review - 5 Stars: I have had this product a few months now.  I work from home, and use this in my home office (which was originally a bedroom) upstairs. It fits on a small table; so, it fits the space perfectly. Although we keep it pretty full, it chills everything super-fast, and keeps everything in it cold.  We keep water, drinks, condiments and sometimes snacks in it.  It is also super-quiet.  Shipping was fast, the price was good, and it works great. I would definitely recommend this item.",

The seals that keep the cold air in, do not seem to work as there are literally hundreds of tiny black flies on the inside of the fridge.

    "text": "Fridge has a significant design flaw that isn't apparent from the product listing. The condensation tube is routed back into the unit itself, with a \"drip tray\" that takes up half of one shelf. With very limited space to begin with, this is ridiculous. Most other similar units have the condensation tube routed outside the unit, and the drip tray near the condenser, on the back of the unit, so it doesn't use up interior space. It's also dumb to have the condensation routed back inside the unit as this leads to mold and other issues. Poor design, wasted space. (As an aside, the shipping packaging is inadequate, we received and returned two damaged units before finally getting a third one that was OK.)",

I needed it in order to survive a kitchen reno and it has really come in handy for that.Plus:+ It's quiet! Even small refrigerators are notorious noise-makers, but this one makes only a subdued whirr when it runs.+ It's not going to fit a ton of stuff, but it stores more than I thought.Minus:- Frost builds up very quickly on the freezer section.- The temperature is not even throughout the fridge. Items stored on the handy little tray under the freezer section tend to freeze, but if you set the temperature control lower to avoid this, the rest of the items in the fridge do get cold enough.- The room for tall standing items doesn't fit much more than a one quart carton of milk or one wine bottle. There is room for 2 bottles to be laid on their sides on the shelves, but the shelf space is lost.",

Very annoying. Good luck falling asleep if you have it in the same room (I'm not a light sleeper and it still bothered me)2) Top shelf freezes over. Don't put eggs and other non-freezer food items in there or else they'll be covered in ice. With 2.4cu space being so limited, it's unacceptable to have it wasted.3) Poor packaging, recommended to buy in store and check on the spot to make sure there's no dents.Verdict:This refrigerator has a great potential, but is ruined by the loud popping noise that compressor makes.

It's set up well and holds everything I need without much trouble, plus it's a great size and opens and closes well, but I gave it almost a month and it's just plain annoying. Everyone saying this fridge is quiet is dead wrong. I bought it for my dorm room because it's made with \"whisper proof technology\" but it makes loud growling sounds every 10-20 which kind of sucks. You can adjust the freezer temperature inside, but all the settings are either as cold as the fridge itself or the depths of antarctica. The freezer temp also leaks into the rest giving all the food in the refrigerator part ice crystals even when it's on a lower setting. I'd except my complaints out of an older fridge, because those do tend to be glitchy and loud, but not from a brand new one:(",

The Midea website was a joke, you could tell that it was not written by a native English speaker...............quite the contrast from the spiffy-looking info from Midea on the Amazon pages. I could not get a good  email address to send them a question. The only resort was to call Malaysia.....of course no help there. They do not stand behind their products, AT ALL. Also, we were unable to get a manual form the website. There was one FAQ ....How to clean the inside with a soft cloth - GEE Thanks - That's a LOT of help..I have never written a review this negative before in my life, but here goes. RUN, do not walk, AWAY from this manufacturer! Find an American  brand or try the store you bought it from for satisfaction. This unit would not even make a good boat anchor. You can buy MUCH BETTER units for the money!",

Feels weird, but it's fine. Once you put it somewhere you'll forget all about it. Out of sight, out of mind. And the power cord being stashed back there as well.I also took it upon myself to take advantage of the reversible door. Figured out how to do it pretty much just by looking at it, so it's easy to understand... and all you need is a Philips screwdriver. But taking out and putting back some of the pieces and screws felt a bit janky. Already scratched the top trying to remove the hole plugs and some of the screws seemed like they didn't quite fit right, really had to push to get them in and was concerned I may break something.

After some experimentation \u201c4\u201d was a good setting to keep things just over freezing but things in the door are refrigerated below 37 degrees. Me happy!
