    "body": "I ordered this for two main reasons - price point and size. That it's also an attractive fridge, is a bonus. I have a small galley kitchen and wanted something that wouldn't overwhelm the space, so that all you notice is the fridge. This fit the bill. Also, this doesn't stick out past the counters as much as some others. That was important to me. Counterdepth fridges were too much compromise on storage space for me. For the size, it's got the best storage capacity compared to other ones I was looking at. I like the smooth finish on the doors. It's pretty. If I had my druthers, I think I would have liked to have a side by side - freezer on one side and fridge on the other. But this is a good compromise, considering the price and space I have to work with. Make sure you have space to fully open the doors. I have a wall on one side and a cabinet on the other side. On the cabinet side, the fridge extends 4 1/2\" past the counter edge. Any less clearance than that would not allow the door to open fully without bumping the countertop. On the wall side, I have 5 1/2\" between the wall and fridge. The door opens ALMOST all the way. It works and I can get shelves and bins out for cleaning and stuff, but I could probably have done with another 1/2 to 1 inch. I'd say, optimally, you need at least 6\" between a wall and the fridge. I love the inside setup and so far, I'm happy with it. It seems to be running well, and I did buy the warranty. Temp controls are a little confusing but I haven't taken much time to figure it out yet. Seems like a good value for the money at this point.",

Last year I replaced my stove and it took weeks, and I didn't want to repeat that experience! But every time I thought I found a unit that would fit my space, budget and desires, it was on backorder, often for months. A few days ago I joked about getting one from Amazon. Just for minor amusement value, I put \"refrigerator\" in the search bar. And there it was, everything I needed for a reasonable price AND they got it to me in 8 days. I gave it 4 stars because it is still very early in the relationship and also because it has made a noise in a door as it closed. No visible problem, and it hasn't been opened a lot yet. Today is the first day of usage, so it is subject to change. But so far I am happy with it. It is sleek, quiet and seems to be just what we needed. I didn't know Amazon sold major appliances.

You get their overflow call center when you call. If you miss their call when they call you back, you have to call back to get in line again with their overflow call center. I never got to speak to anyone on a call that I initiated. They always say, we\u2019ll all you back. Too bad and never mind if youre an adult with a job where you cant be glued to your phone.Today they finally say they *cannot* help me. They gave a number for service. Service tells me the roller coaster issue is a lost cause.  \u201cCall Galanz back ma\u2019am\u201d Galanz tells me mail the following: cut the plug off, bag it, take the serial number stickers off, any stickers, mail them by USPS only. In 8-10 wks you\u2019ll be issued a check for the base price minus taxes. You dispose of the machine at your own cost.\u201dSo what shall I do without a fridge for 8-10 wks? I have to to pay for its disposal and no refund on taxes and warranty cost? Assurant would not step in to help because it was less than a year.I would not recommend to anyone!5/2021I like how sleek it looks. Love the doors and freezer on the bottom. Has tiny casters/wheels that I hope hold up and are nice to my wooden floors.Just one tiny issue, i am missing a tiny couple of screws that go into the handle and tighten with a small wrench. I called amazon and they tried to say they would send a whole new fridge. Completely unnecessary for something found within the fridge packaging. Called and left a message. Never got a call back.",

Roomy condiment shelves in the doors and a cool glass shelf that seperates into two narrow half shelves. Also very handy. I waited to do the review to see how it lasts. Its been great.
